Work on multiple frontend projects using html, css and multiple css frameworks

- Skeleton
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS
- Foundation
- Bulma

javascript framework

- Vue 
- ReactJs
- Angular Js

but what would the frontend be without the backend!?

I work with native languages like 
- javascript obviously 
- python
-  Php

Even if I mainly use frameworks, my knowledge of the language helps me to master frameworks perfectly.
I love discovering new technologies and taking on new challenges with new ambitious projects.
